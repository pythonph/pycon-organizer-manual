## Preparation for PyCon
- Come up with the theme. This is one of the first things to be done. The Python.Ph board of directors would have a short list of possible themes.
- Contact potential speakers.
- Maintain a database for speakers. 
- Request speakers for profile picture and speaker information.
- Create a schedule. This should be done at least 2 months before the conference.
- Select an emcee and brief them.
- Apply for a CHED endorsement.

## During the PyCon
- Ready the speakers before their speaking slot.
- Remind the emcee of things that needs to be mentioned. (Check the [Emcee section](emcee.md))

## After the PyCon
- Provide feedback and suggestions on the experience of the program committee

## Selecting the Speakers

It is Python.PH's priority to ensure that quality of talks and speakers for PyCon is maintained. 

To remove any expectations that we will shoulder the speakers' traveling expenses, the call for speaker page should contain this line:

```Please note that since this is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit conference, we cannot reimburse your travel costs.```

An exception is made for the keynote speakers on a case-by-case basis.

### Keynote Speakers

A shortlist is usually provided by the PyCon Chair on people that can be a Keynote speaker. It is the responsibility of the Program committee to contact these potential Keynote speakers.

### Workshop Speakers

For workshop speakers, the committee should also obtain the following information:
- Length of workshop
- Diffculty level
- Maximum participant size
- Pre-requisite knowledge
- Software, library, and/or hardware pre-requisites for the workshop. These should be coordinated with the venue.
- Any other assistance needed

### Confirmation of speakers

1. Use president@python.ph to send the approval of speakers. This is to add legitimacy to the letter and to make the speakers feel good that the president themself is sending the letter.
2. Ask in the approval letter if the foreign speaker needs help with the visa. If they do, coordinate with the [Guest Relations team](guest-relations.md).

### CHED Endorsement

This is required for the education sector to participate in PyCon. 

At CHED Central, look for the Records Room. You can tell the front desk that you want CHED to endorse a conference.

It will take two weeks to complete this, so have this ready at least two month before PyCon. The earlier, the better as this needs to be added to a school's calendar.

Bring two copies of the following:

1. Speakers Profile
1. Talks
1. Program Schedule
1. SEC Registration / Certificate of Incorporation
1. Invitation Letter. Must contain the following:

- Objective
- Venue
- Ticket cost
- Contact details
