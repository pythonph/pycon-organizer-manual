# Ticketing

This team is responsible for making sure that PyCon's ticket system is working and that the money is properly accounted for. Because this team involves money, the treasurer of Python.Ph will be the de-facto leader of this committee.

There should be a cut-off for tickets sold online. This is to give the entire PyCon team some breathing room before PyCon. It will be under the discretion of the PyCon head if tickets will still be sold at the event.

## Responsibilities
- Contact a payment service (we used ticketbase.com during PyCon 2015 and 2016).
- Collaborate with the website and design team for linking to the payment service.
- Be at the front desk to ensure that people who brought tickets are allowed in.
- Sell PyCon merchandise such as T-shirts.

## Preparation for PyCon
- Contact ticketbase.com before PyCon is announced.
- Test the flow for getting a PyCon ticket.
- One day before PyCon, prepare a long table for ticket check-in.

## During PyCon
- Print a list of people who brought tickets.
- Assing at least one person per one hundred participants.

## After PyCon
- Prepare a report for the PSF
- Prepare a report on the PyCon demographic.
- Prepare a confidential report on ticket sale, t-shirt sale, etc. This report will be submitted to PythonPH's treasurer.
