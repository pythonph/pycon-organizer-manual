# Fundraising

Just like any other endeavor, we need funding to bring our ideas to life. Conferences incur big expenses such as the venue, food, logistics, travel, etc. 

PyCon.PH strives for the diversity of its audience -- we can't achieve that if our tickets are too expensive.

## Responsiblities
- Looking for Sponsors
- Contacting Sponsors
- Maintain a database of Sponsors for the present and future PyCon.
- Match what a Sponsor needs and what we can offer.
- Prepare Memorandum of Agreement (MoA).
- Seal the deal.

## Preparation for PyCon
- A Memorandum of Agreement is helpful for establishing exactly what the Sponsor will offer.
- Two weeks before PyCon, contact the sponsors with regard to the giveaways (if any). Coordinate with the [Logistics](logistics.md).

## During the PyCon
- Make sure that the sponsors are well presented.
- Coordinate with the [Documentation](documentation.md) committee to ensure that the sponsors are mentioned on social media.

## After the PyCon
- Send a thank you letter to the sponsors.

## Tips for getting sponsors
- Looking for sponsors can be tedious. Getting as many as possible involved in the process can go a long way. Create letter templates for prospective sponsors and have the team send them out. It might be tempting to automate this but it's better if you don't. By doing this manually, you will unconciously put more thought and effort to your letters.

- Start early! Allot at least 4 months before the event for getting sponsors.

- Consider these [psychological pricing strategies](http://www.nickkolenda.com/psychological-pricing-strategies/).

- A Memorandum of Agreement is helpful for establishing exactly what the Sponsor will offer. This will prevent some Sponsors from adding new items *after* the deal is completed.

## Sponsorship packages
It's always hard to ask for money. Sponsorship packages help us avoid the negotiating dance. Have a least 3 tiers and expect some companies to request for different benefits.
