# Logistics

This team is very demanding before and during the conference. However, we've planned the team so that Logistic will not be working after the conference. However for feedback purposes, they will still be expected during the retrospective event.

The challenge in this team involves venue sourcing, selection, and preparation; arrangement of catering for snacks, meals, and drinks.

## Responsibilities

The Logistics team is responsible for:

- communicating with the venue.
- conference food and communicating with catering
- volunteer briefing
- contributor's dinner (sponsors, speakers and volunteers)
- communicating with the catering
- footwork and heavy lifting

## Venue
Reservation of venue should include the following:
- Conference hall for at least 300pax for Day 1 and Day 2
- At least 2 classrooms for Workshops. Coordinate with Program team on the classroom size that the workshop speakers need.
- War room for volunteers (a small classroom will do)
- Sound system, microphone, projector, projector screen, internet connection, electric outlet, extension cords, etc
- Consider parking spaces (parking spaces at nearby establishments will do)

## Food
The ideal situation is to find a caterer who will take care of everything such as setting up the tables and distributing the meals. But if it is not possible to get a caterer, packed meals are sufficient.

Be sure to have the following for the entire conference:
   - AM snacks
   - Lunch
   - PM Snacks
   - Water
   - Water Dispenser
   - Tissue Paper
   - Untensils
   - Coffee (you can invite someone to sell it at the conference)

## Preparation for PyCon
- Find a venue for PyCon. They need to do an ocular visit.
- Contact the sponsors on any giveaways. Find a location where the items can be delivered to.
- Find a caterer that can deliver to the venue.
- Coordinate with the venue in regards to the catering. Some venues have strict guidelines for catering.
- One week before PyCon:
-- Prepare the war room.
-- Prepare signs that can help visitors find the conference, classrooms and restrooms.
-- Coordinate with caterer
- The team should have a map of the venue and other important locations such as the nearest infirmary, hospital, and police station.
- Plan the routes within the venue. For example, the route from one building to another in case a workshop or talk will be held elsewhere. Make sure members of your team knows the route.

## During PyCon
- Make sure that there is at least one person in the war room. That person will guard a lot of equipment, so if needed, assign two people.
- Assign people at strategic location. Don't forget to rotate people so they will have time to enjoy the conference.
- Talk to the different teams and see what they need.
- Be prepared to do footwork.
- Be prepared to do footwork.
- Be prepared to do a lot of footwork.

## After PyCon
- Relax. Your work is done. Let the other team handle the rest.
