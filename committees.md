# Volunteer Committee Head

As a committee leader, you are responsible for coordinating to your committee volunteers, identifying tasks that need to be done, proper delegation and providing clear instructions to them.

## Preparation for PyCon
- Identify the actionable items for your team.
- Assign each volunteer to an action
- Be sure to know what to do during an emergency. Coordinate with the security committee.

## During the PyCon
- Communicate with your team and the PyCon Chair.
- Be pro-active in any potential problems. If you identify one, fix it before it becomes an issue
- While the Chair has the final decision, during an emergency or if necessarily, you have to make a decision on the spot.

## After the PyCon
- Relax. Managing a conference is a hard and fulfilling endeavor. You deserve to relax


# Tips for managing volunteers

Each leader has their own management style. But for first-timers or those who are unsure of how to do their roles, we recommend the following:

- **Prepare `goals` for your committee.** This is in addition to the goals the PyCon Chair assigns to you. These goals should be meant to push your committee to a higher bar.

```This is a psychological trick where you set a target that is beyond the minimum. This will give you greater focus without compromising the minimum requirement.

Boxers also use this technique during training by visualizing their target behind the punching bag. This will make their punches hit harder```

- **Constant communication.** Set a time and date where you and your team will meet, either online or offline.

- **Delegate.** You can't do everything. This is why you have a team.

- Some volunteers are shy at first. It might be a good idea to **meet them for coffee/dinner** so you can give them instructions in person and to make them feel more comfortable talking to you.

- Based on experience, one of the best ways to lead an open source community is to **lead by example**.
