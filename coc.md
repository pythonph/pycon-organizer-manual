# Code of Conduct
The attendees and volunteers are required to abide and follow the [Code of Conduct for PyCon PH](https://pycon.python.ph/code-of-conduct/).

In addition, volunteers are required to read the [Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/), [sign](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mky-a8ZQ8b9kLvE0bwURETJWHX0opO2tTBleRzcdW3g/viewform) and agree to it before they are accepted as a volunteer.

## Rationale

PyCon is a community conference where attendees are from different walks of life. To accomodate this diversity, the organizers must prepare an environment where participants will feel safe and respected, regardless of their gender, personal belief, or opinions. This is to promote collaboration and a spirit of community.

In an unfortunate event where someone is harrassed during the event (or due to connections formed during the conference), the Code of Conduct can be used as grounds for any actions the leaders will decide. On minor offenses, the offender can be warned or escorted out of the coference. On major offenses, Python.Ph will blacklist the offender from future events.

In addition, the PSF will only sponsor PyCons that have a Code of Conduct.

## Preparation for PyCon

- Review the Code of Conduct from the previous year. Apply any changes needed.
- Set up the canonical url for the CoC.
- Double check that the main page for the event has a link to the CoC.
- Double check that PyCon tickets have a link to the CoC.
- Make sure that the volunteers are aware of the CoC.
- The security committee must review the CoC. Their contact details (e.g. phone numbers and uniform worn at the event) must be in the document.
- Prepare a safety room in case individuals needed to be separated. Assign a guard if needed. The war room can double as a safety room, in case the venue does not have an extra room.

## During the PyCon

- Make sure that the CoC is easily accessible for the participants. This can be done via a url on the tickets or as printed material.
- Announce the CoC at the start of each PyCon day and during breaks (at the emcee's discretion).

## After the PyCon

- Report any unwanted incidents during the event.
- Review the Code of Conduct to see if all unwanted incidents are covered. If a particular harassment is not in the CoC, document the needed change. **Do not** change the current CoC as any change would give the offenders legal ammunition that the document was retroactively changed.
