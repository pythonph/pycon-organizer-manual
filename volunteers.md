# Volunteers

**The Python Conference lives and dies by its volunteers.** The more volunteers there are, the easier the individual work load is. The strength of each individual volunteer will have a direct improvement to the event.

To bring in volunteers, the leaders should post a `Call for Volunteers` on social media. Each volunteer will sign up to a committee they are interested in helping. Each committee leader is responsible for debriefing the volunteer and assigning tasks to them.


## Perks of volunteering
- Portfolio and Résumé.
- Volunteer Certificate.
- Experience in hosting a major event.
- Volunteer exclusive T-shirts.
- Free entry to the conference (please note our Everyone Pays policy).
- Free food.
- After PyCon party with fellow volunteers and speakers.
- Invitation to PyCon team building event.


## "Everyone Pays" Policy

DjangoCon has a policy where ["everybody pays"](http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/everybody-pays). The rationale behind this is to increase the quality of the conference. We've implemented a similar policy since PyCon 2015.

Python.Ph acknowledges that the Philippines is a poor country and not everyone can afford to pay for the tickets. Our "Everyone Pays" policy has one change: if you are a volunteer or speaker, but you can afford to pay, help us increase the quality of PyCon.

In essence, this policy is optional.

## Preparation for PyCon
- Review the [Committees and Responsibilities](https://github.com/pythonph/pycon-organizer-manual/wiki/D.-Committees-and-Responsibilities) section.
- Assign the leaders for each committee.
- Post on social media a "Call for Volunteers".
- Send the volunteer a link to the Code of Conduct for them to accept.
- Each committee leader should welcome and debrief the volunteers on their role. It is up to the leader's discretion on how to handle their team.

## During the PyCon
- The PyCon Chair will be reponsible for coordinating with each committee leader. In extreme cases, a volunteer can contact the PyCon Chair directly.
- Volunteers should take note on any feedback from the audience or themselves. Feedbacks will be useful during the PyCon Retrospective.

## After the PyCon
- Volunteers should debrief their leaders on any feedback.
- Volunteers should join the PyCon Retrospective and help in raising the bar for the next PyCon.

### Response for volunteers who signed up

> Thanks for your interest in becoming a volunteer for PyConPH! We can't stress enough that the spirit of volunteerism is what makes the Python community and tech events like PyCon distinctly inspiring. We need all the help we can get.

> You may refer to the [Committees and Responsibilities](https://github.com/pythonph/pycon-organizer-manual/wiki/D.-Committees-and-Responsibilities) section to have an idea of the responsibilities assigned for each committee.

> Once you've decided which committee you'd like to be part of, please fill-out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SpJgtnp4MoAArCzT_pVj_kxptQR-mL1ts6B_j7xGX0w/viewform) and we'll get in touch with you as soon as we can. Note that volunteer slots per committee are limited so we might put you on wait-list if the volunteer limit for the committee you signed up for has already been reached. 

> Don't be shy, say hi to the PyCon committee on slack and introduce yourself :)
