# Responsibilities

The Stagehand committee are responsible for:

- extra equipments such as projector, microphone, tables, laptop, etc.
- fixing things in case something goes wrong on-stage.
- catering to the needs of the audience.
- ensuring that our [Code of Conduct](http://pycon.python.ph/coc.html) is enforced throughout the conference.
- timing talks.

## Preparation for PyCon
- The committee should eyeball the venue at least two months before the PyCon starts. This will give them a sense of what is needed.
- The committee should be at the venue one or two days prior to the PyCon. They need to have an inventory on what is missing and what they are bringing. They should also setup the `war room`.
- Prepare for extra equipments. Here are some examples:
1. Projector
1. Microphone
1. Tables
1. Laptop
1. HDMI, DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, Firewire, VGA converter
1. Micro-USB, USB, USB-C converter
1. Flash drive
1. Paper
1. Marker

## During the PyCon
- The committee should pay attention to the needs of a speaker. If you've noticed that their microphone or converter isn't working, immediately go to the stage and offer a replacement.

## After the PyCon
- The committee should ensure that extra equipments are properly stored.
- Provide feedback and suggestions on the experience of the stagehand committee
