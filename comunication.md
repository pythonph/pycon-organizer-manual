# Communication between volunteers

There are three main channels for communicating between volunteers: Offline, Slack, and Trello. The PyCon Chair will call for meetings on any of these channels.

## Offline meetings

This is the most productive channel between the three. However, this is hard to organize as it needs the members to have a common schedule for free time.

A suggestion to maximize this channel is for each committee to organize at least one offline meeting and summarize their goals on Slack or another channel. The committee leader can also decide to inform the chair of their decisions. This way, the Chair has all the information needed to make informed decisions.

The PyCon Chair will call for at least two offline meeting: one for planning and another before the PyCon to make sure everyone is in sync.

## Slack

This is the easiest channel to share information. Because Slack stores the previous messages, everyone can stay informed with the decisions and conversations. And if an individual is needed, Slack can email that person via its mentioning feature.

The disadvantage of Slack is that if a volunteer do not regularly check Slack, they will get overwhelmed with messages. It is very easy for a Slack channel to have a large backlog of messages. This can contribute to fatigue as we have experienced some questions that has already been answered the day before but was missed. A way to manage this information is to have multiple channels for each committee.

## Trello

This channel is for itemizing a volunteer's workflow. Trello makes it easy to figure out who is doing what and if they would need assistance. Trello is combined with Slack for any discussions on the tickets, as the commenting system is not polished.

Trello is a great way to simplify the organization of PyCon as it creates a clear path toward completing each committee's work flow.
